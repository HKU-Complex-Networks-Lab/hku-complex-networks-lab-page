We are pleased to announce that the HKU Complex Networks Laboratory has been awarded a major grant from the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong under the General Research Fund (GRF) scheme. The grant, totaling HK$1,200,000, will support our research project titled "Resilience and Efficiency in Multilayer Urban Transportation Networks" over the next three years.

## Project Overview

This project will develop new methodologies for analyzing and optimizing urban transportation systems using multilayer network models. By treating different transportation modes (metro, buses, taxis, shared mobility) as interconnected layers of a complex network, we aim to:

- Quantify the resilience of integrated transportation systems
- Develop optimization strategies to improve system efficiency
- Create data-driven tools to support urban transportation planning

## Impact and Applications

The research will have direct applications for urban transportation planning in Hong Kong and other dense urban environments. By improving our understanding of how different transportation modes interact as a unified system, we can better prepare for disruptions and design more efficient networks.

The grant will fund:
- A postdoctoral researcher position
- PhD student support
- Computing resources and research travel
- Data acquisition and processing

We are grateful to the RGC for their support and look forward to sharing the results of this research with the scientific community and the public.
